Numerical Methods
Programming Assignment 3

We have discussed approaches to sampling hyperspheres.  The general equation is as follows:


Where r is the unit radius,  is the angle in radians and d is the dimensionality of the hypersphere.

In addition, we discussed Archimedes’ theorem, that the area of a sphere equals the area of every right circular cylinder circumscribed about the sphere (excluding the bases). The axial projection of any measurable region on a sphere on the right circular cylinder circumscribed about the sphere preserves area.

    Your first task is to write a professionally documented functioning program that allows the user to input ranges for r and  and produce a two-dimensional image sampling of a circle segment.  By testing a variety of user inputs, provide a summary description of the ways in which the user input affects the graphical output.
    Your second task is to extend the concept to three dimensions (adding) and again, allow for different values of r, .  Describe in summary what affect different values of the variables has on the output.

You can use any programming language you like to implement the program. However, I would point out that Python has some excellent graphical output libraries.

The due date for the assignment is December 5th at midnight
